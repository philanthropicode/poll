My prompt:

I think I need to give you some context. For example, I don't hink we need the submissionLatest collection and that we can just use a submissions collection. Here are the prompts that led to where we are below. Please recommend a course of action for merging changes, if they're appropriate, and propose updates needed to get the changes to work.

```
I'd like to create a component for a mapbox map that appears on the poll page for user after a user starts submitting responses to polls. The map will be a heatmap that's generated and colored based on the sum of of all users' responses for a selected question in a poll. There will be a set radio button that allows users to select the question from which the map is generated. For example, if a user selects a radio button for the second question in a poll, then the map will show, for each h3r8 region, a color based on the sum of all users' responses for question two in that poll, wherein the colors are based on the minimum and maximum values for the h3r8 regions that are in the map view.
---
Let's work on pre-aggregating by H3 r8 per question. We will need to create or update polls' h3Agg subcollection documents (e.g., polls/{pollId}/h3Agg/{h3}) with sums when users submit their polls (when users click on the submit button, not when they merely move slider positions.). We will want to track different aggregate values for each question -- The sum of all users' response values for the given question, the total value of positive response values for the given question, the total value of negative response values for the given question, the number of users that submitted positive response values for the given question, and the number of users that submitted negative response values for the given question. We also need to track the number of users that submitted responses to the polls. The number of users that either set the value for a question to zero or didn't answer a question (i.e., left the value at zero) can be calculated based on subtracting the number of users that left a positive or negative values for a question from the total number of users that submitted a response to the poll. - [ ] Should we just also track the number of users for which the value of the response was set to zero? For now, we will only use the overall sum of all response values for each question to generate maps, but I think we should track the additional values for future analysis. - [ ] Is this bad practice that will lead to storing too much data?
---
Yes, please add a tiny admin backfill, read API, and data guard. Thanks for adding the zeroCount. Keep in mind that users can resubmit polls, so we need to handle updates as well as creates. In addition to the above: The user's h3 ID is stored in a h3r8 map fields in a geo map in a document at profiles/{userId}. We need to change the name of the h3r8 map field because we want to use a different resolutions for different locations, based on populaton density. Maybe we shoud remove h3r8 and have one field for the h3 ID and another for the h3 resolution. The number of indices in this application is pretty low, so we can afford to have a composite index on pollId and questionId in the submissions collection. This will make the export function faster and will allow us to conduct analysis on the data from different polls more easily.
---
If we're at a boundary, where users' h3 resolutions change (e.g., from 7 to 8), how is that represented on the map? I would assume that the map should use the higher resolution and apply the lower resolution h3 values to the overlapping child h3 regions.
---
It looks like you've nested poll submission documents under each poll submission within the polls collection rather than leaving submissions in their own collection. I think leaving submissions in their own collections would allow use to search and filter submissions from different polls in the future (e.g., based on topic) without needing to create composite indices. Below are my current firestore rules along with the changes you suggested at the end.
---
Instead of requiring 1 submission per user per poll, let's allow users to resubmit their responses, but not immediately sync their results. Maybe recalculate the poll results once every few hours or upon an admin's request.
---
You consolidated the submissions for each user and question into a single document. Wouldn't it be better to keep each submission as a separate document, so we can add a topic to the submission so we can use a set of submissions from separate polls for future analysis? Current data model, which haven't taken any of our suggestions from this chat into account yet: submissions document ID: pollId__userId__questionId - comment - pollId - questionId - userId - updatedAt
---
wait, did you add an event log because you thought I wanted to track submission history? Do we really need to track submission history rather than just the final submission values?
---
I'm completely out of sync with all the files we've created and updated in this chat. Output the full text for each file we've discussed, in it's final state, based on what we've discussed.
```

Thanks for the additional context. You can keep a single submissions collection and still meet all goals (scale, privacy, resubmission, periodic recompute). Below is a concrete merge plan that retains submissions, adopts a periodic rollup, and aligns code, rules, and indexes for production.

Recommended architecture (with submissions only)

- Write model

  - submissions/{pollId}__{userId}__{questionId}

    - Fields: pollId, questionId, userId, value:number, comment?:string|null, updatedAt:serverTimestamp(), submitted:boolean
    - Optional privacy-safe location: location?: { h3: { id:string, res:number } }

  - submissions/{pollId}__{userId}__status
    - Fields: pollId, userId, createdAt, submittedAt

- Profile model
  - profiles/{uid}.geo.h3 = { id, res } plus lat/lng if you need them server-side; clients never write geo fields directly.

- Aggregates (multi-resolution for map)
  - polls/{pollId}/h3Agg_r9|r8|r7/{h3}
    - Fields: stats[questionId] = { sum, posSum, negSum, posCount, negCount, zeroCount }, totalRespondents, updatedAt

- Flow

  - Client saves per-question docs at submissions/... with submitted:false during editing.
  - On final Submit, the client sets submitted:true on those per-question docs (and writes/updates the status doc).
  - A Firestore onWrite trigger on submissions only marks the poll as dirty (cheap, scalable).
  - A scheduler (every 3 hours) and an admin callable recompute aggregates for dirty polls from submissions where submitted==true.

Why this merges cleanly

- You avoid per-write aggregation complexity and race conditions.
- You keep submissions as you prefer for later analysis and indexing.
- Multi-res aggregates (r9/8/7) address mixed-resolution boundaries by letting the client choose a uniform resolution per zoom level; no blending required at query time.

Concrete updates to apply

1. Functions packaging and H3 API

- Problem: You have .ts files that are not built, index.js re-exports "./aggregate" (ts), and your h3-js version is v4 (uses latLngToCell/cellToParent, not geoToH3).

- Action:

  - Choose one:

    - A. TypeScript build (recommended): add tsconfig.json, add a build script (tsc), set "main" to compiled lib/index.js, rename index.js â†’ index.ts and export your functions there.
    - B. Convert the few TS files to JS ESM and fix imports to use explicit extensions.

  - Replace any geoToH3 usage with latLngToCell from h3-js v4.

  - Ensure initializeApp() is called only once globally.

2. Aggregate functions (periodic rollup, multi-resolution)

- Replace functions/src/api.ts with a single-source-of-truth rollup using submissions (top-level) and profiles for h3 when needed:

  - scheduledRollup: every 3 hours; queries polls where meta.dirty==true; calls rollupPoll(pollId).
  - rollupNow: callable for admins; calls rollupPoll(pollId).
  - getH3Agg (HTTP): /api/polls/:pollId/h3Agg?questionId=Q\&res=8; read from polls/{pollId}/h3Agg_r8.

- rollupPoll specifics:

  - Input: submissions.where("pollId","==",pollId).where("submitted","==",true).
  - Location: prefer s.location?.h3.id if present; otherwise fetch profiles/{s.userId}.geo.h3 (skip if none).
  - Compute r9, parent r8, parent r7 via cellToParent.
  - Counters per question: sum, posSum, negSum, posCount, negCount, zeroCount.
  - totalRespondents per cell: count unique userIds per H3 cell (dedupe) to avoid overcount across multiple question docs.
  - Clear and rewrite h3Agg_r7/8/9 subcollections for that poll.

- Keep a tiny onWrite trigger on submissions to set polls/{pollId}.meta.dirty=true, lastSubmissionAt=serverTimestamp().

3. Security rules (firebase.rules)

- Keep submissions (not submissionsLatest). Strengthen with ID pattern and read privacy:

  - Only owner or poll admin can read submissions docs.

  - Create/update:

    - Must be signed in.
    - request.resource.id == (pollId + "__" + uid + "__" + questionId).
    - poll is open.

  - Status doc: restrict to owner.

- Aggregates (read-only):
  - match /polls/{pollId}/h3Agg_r{res}/{h3} { allow read: if true; allow write: if false; }

- Profiles:
  - Forbid client writes to geo/lat/lng/h3 fields (keep your current restriction).

- Keep your feedback rules as-is.

- Note: If you keep city/state/zip out of submissions, no extra rule needed there; recommend removing those fields from client writes.

4. Indexes (valid JSON)

- Replace your firestore.indexes.json with: { "indexes": [ { "collectionGroup": "submissions", "queryScope": "COLLECTION", "fields": [ { "fieldPath": "pollId", "order": "ASCENDING" }, { "fieldPath": "questionId", "order": "ASCENDING" } ] } ], "fieldOverrides": [ { "collectionGroup": "h3Agg_r7", "fieldPath": "stats", "indexes": [], "shouldIndex": false }, { "collectionGroup": "h3Agg_r8", "fieldPath": "stats", "indexes": [], "shouldIndex": false }, { "collectionGroup": "h3Agg_r9", "fieldPath": "stats", "indexes": [], "shouldIndex": false } ] }

5. Frontend updates (privacy + submitted flag)

- PollView.jsx:

  - Remove stamping city/state/zip into submission docs.
  - When persisting per-question answers, write submitted:false during editing; on final Submit, update those docs to submitted:true.
  - Keep your status doc for UX but aggregation filters by submitted:true on per-question docs.

- src/lib/callables.js:
  - Optionally export rollupNow (admin) and saveUserAddress for profile setup.

6. Profile callable

- Implement saveUserAddress to write profiles/{uid}.geo.h3 = { id, res } with lat/lng server-side only. Frontend should never write geo fields.

7. CSV export

- Update exportPollCsv to read from submissions where pollId==... and submitted==true. Continue to avoid userId in rows. If you ever include location, prefer non-PII h3 id/res, not city/state/zip.

Example code changes (representative snippets)

- Cloud Function: mark poll dirty on submissions writes // functions/src/aggregate.ts export const onSubmissionWrite = onDocumentWritten( { document: "submissions/{id}", region: "us-central1" }, async (event) => { const before = event.data?.before?.data(); const after = event.data?.after?.data(); const pollId = after?.pollId || before?.pollId; if (!pollId) return; await db.doc(`polls/${pollId}`).set({ meta: { dirty: true, lastSubmissionAt: FieldValue.serverTimestamp() } }, { merge: true }); } );

- Rollup (core flow using h3-js v4) // functions/src/api.ts import { latLngToCell, cellToParent } from "h3-js"; async function rollupPoll(pollId: string) { const subs = await db.collection("submissions") .where("pollId", "==", pollId) .where("submitted", "==", true) .get();

  const profileCache = new Map<string, { h3?: { id: string; res: number }, lat?: number, lng?: number }>(); const agg: Record<number, Record<string, { stats: any; userIds: Set }>> = { 9:{},8:{},7:{} };

  for (const d of subs.docs) { const s = d.data() as any; const uid = s.userId; let h3id = s.location?.h3?.id as string | undefined; let res = s.location?.h3?.res as number | undefined;

  ```javascript
  if (!h3id) {
    if (!profileCache.has(uid)) {
      const p = await db.doc(`profiles/${uid}`).get();
      profileCache.set(uid, p.exists ? p.data()?.geo || {} : {});
    }
    const geo = profileCache.get(uid) || {};
    if (geo?.h3?.id) {
      h3id = geo.h3.id; res = geo.h3.res;
    } else if (Number.isFinite(geo.lat) && Number.isFinite(geo.lng)) {
      h3id = latLngToCell(geo.lat, geo.lng, 9); res = 9;
    }
  }
  if (!h3id) continue;

  const r9 = res === 9 ? h3id : cellToParent(h3id, 9);
  const r8 = cellToParent(r9, 8);
  const r7 = cellToParent(r9, 7);
  const entries: Array<[number, string]> = [[9, r9],[8, r8],[7, r7]];

  const q = s.questionId;
  const v = Number.isFinite(s.value) ? s.value : 0;
  const c = { sum:v, posSum: v>0?v:0, negSum: v<0?v:0, posCount:v>0?1:0, negCount:v<0?1:0, zeroCount:v===0?1:0 };

  for (const [r, cell] of entries) {
    const layer = (agg[r] ||= {});
    const rec = (layer[cell] ||= { stats: {}, userIds: new Set<string>() });
    const stat = (rec.stats[q] ||= { sum:0, posSum:0, negSum:0, posCount:0, negCount:0, zeroCount:0 });
    stat.sum += c.sum; stat.posSum += c.posSum; stat.negSum += c.negSum;
    stat.posCount += c.posCount; stat.negCount += c.negCount; stat.zeroCount += c.zeroCount;
    rec.userIds.add(uid);
  }
  ```

  }

  // clear+write for (const r of [9,8,7]) { const snap = await db.collection(`polls/${pollId}/h3Agg_r${r}`).get(); const batch = db.batch(); snap.forEach((doc) => batch.delete(doc.ref)); await batch.commit();

  ```javascript
  const now = FieldValue.serverTimestamp();
  const writes: Promise<any>[] = [];
  for (const [h3, rec] of Object.entries(agg[r] || {})) {
    writes.push(
      db.collection(`polls/${pollId}/h3Agg_r${r}`).doc(h3)
        .set({ stats: rec.stats, totalRespondents: (rec.userIds as Set<string>).size, updatedAt: now }, { merge: true })
    );
  }
  await Promise.all(writes);
  ```

  }

  await db.doc(`polls/${pollId}`).set({ meta: { dirty:false, lastRolledAt: FieldValue.serverTimestamp() } }, { merge: true }); }

- HTTP read API (per resolution) export const getH3Agg = onRequest({ region:"us-central1", cors: true }, async (req, res) => { const parts = req.path.split("/").filter(Boolean); const pollId = parts[parts.indexOf("polls")+1]; const questionId = String((req.query as any).questionId || ""); const reso = Number((req.query as any).res || 8); if (!pollId || !questionId) return res.status(400).json({ error: "pollId & questionId required" });

  const col = db.collection(`polls/${pollId}/h3Agg_r${reso}`); const snap = await col.get(); const aggs: Array<{ h3:string; sum:number }> = []; snap.forEach((d) => { const s = (d.data() as any)?.stats?.[questionId]; if (s && typeof s.sum === "number") aggs.push({ h3: d.id, sum: s.sum }); }); res.json({ aggs }); });

- Rules: add read-only aggregates and stronger submissions constraints // inside match /databases/{database}/documents match /polls/{pollId}/h3Agg_r{res}/{h3} { allow read: if true; allow write: if false; } match /submissions/{id} { allow read: if isSignedIn() && (resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid || isPollAdmin(resource.data.pollId)); allow create: if isSignedIn() && request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid && id == (request.resource.data.pollId + '__' + request.auth.uid + '__' + request.resource.data.questionId) && pollOpen(request.resource.data.pollId); allow update: if isSignedIn() && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid && id == (resource.data.pollId + '__' + request.auth.uid + '__' + resource.data.questionId) && pollOpen(resource.data.pollId); allow delete: if false; }

- Frontend: remove PII in submissions and add submitted flag // When saving per-question during editing: await setDoc(doc(db,"submissions", `${pollId}__${user.uid}__${qid}`), { pollId, userId: user.uid, questionId: qid, value, comment, submitted: false, updatedAt: serverTimestamp() }, { merge: true });

  // On final submit: for (const qid of Object.keys(answersRef.current)) { await setDoc(doc(db,"submissions", `${pollId}__${user.uid}__${qid}`), { submitted: true, updatedAt: serverTimestamp() }, { merge: true }); }

Decisions and trade-offs to confirm

- Respondent counting accuracy: Using unique userIds per H3 cell avoids inflation from multiple questions; prior versions incremented per answer and would overcount totalRespondents.

- Location source: Recommended to avoid copying PII to submissions. You can either:

  - Keep location only in profiles and let rollup join on profiles (simpler now; slightly heavier rollup), or
  - Denormalize only h3.id/res onto submissions (still privacy-safe) when saving answers.

- Functions packaging: I recommend switching to a TypeScript build so all functions live in src/ and are compiled to lib/ for deployment. If you prefer JS, Iâ€™ll convert TS to JS and fix imports.

If you approve this direction, toggle to

Act Mode (âŒ˜â‡§A) and Iâ€™ll:

- Set up functions TypeScript build, fix h3-js v4 usage.
- Replace api.ts with multi-res rollup/HTTP/read + scheduled/admin trigger.
- Replace aggregate.ts with dirty-marker on submissions.
- Implement a working profile.ts saveUserAddress with geo.h3 = { id, res }.
- Update firebase.rules and firestore.indexes.json with the exact rules and valid JSON above.
- Update PollView.jsx to remove PII writes and add submitted flag handling.
- Update exportPollCsv to submissions + submitted==true query.

This keeps your single submissions collection, protects privacy, supports resubmission, scales via periodic rollups, and produces efficient multi-resolution aggregates for heatmaps.
