# Default to a harmless long-running process; compose will override with per-service commands
CMD ["bash", "-lc", "node -e \"setInterval(()=>{},1e9)\""]


# NOTE
#   Donâ€™t run firebase login during build.
#   Run `firebase login --no-localhost` in the container to authenticate
#   Use firebase deploy --token "$FIREBASE_TOKEN" at runtime when you actually deploy.
#
#   To get a token locally: 
#       `firebase login:ci` (copies a token you can put in .env and pass into compose).
#       Inside the container, `firebase login --no-localhost` also works interactively.

# NOTE
#   To execute commands in the container, use:
#     podman exec -it poll bash
